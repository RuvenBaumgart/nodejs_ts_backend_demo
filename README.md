# Basic Nodejs Backend using Typescript and Mongoose
## Demoproject to demonstrate the architecture of a nodejs backend

In this small demoproject I'm building a backend with nodejs, typescript and mongoose. It's a really small
Project to demonstrate how a possible architecture can look using this kind of techstack. 

The backend enables you to store a "secret" as a string representation. The secret will be send to the backend within the body of a post route. If you succesfully save a secret you will receive a secretId to get your previous stored secret back via a get route.

 Basically it is showing basic CRUD operations without the UD. However, update and delete can be easily implemented.
